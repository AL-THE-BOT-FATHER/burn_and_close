## Recover SOL from your open token accounts.

Each token account is about .002 SOL which adds up if you have a lot of "dust". 

***Do not add*** token accounts with tokens that are actually worth something. 

### Instructions:
Fill in your RPC, priv key (base58 string), and add your old token accounts to the list. 

-Search your wallet on solscan.io. 

-Click the blue wallet icon.

-Uncheck "Hide zero token balance".
